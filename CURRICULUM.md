# A Full Stack From the Outside In

WDI students know how websites should look and work. The challenge of WDI is to enable students to translate their visions of "an app that connects cooks" into a reality in a full stack app. For this reason primarily it makes sense to teach from the **Outside In** - from the front end to the backend.

## Outside In WDI Curriculum

      Week 2 - Underscore, jQuery
      Week 3 - APIs & AngularJS
      Week 4 - AngularJS, APIs, Firebase
      Week 5 - Project 1 (Angular Front End Project)
    Back End
      Week 6 - Node/Express API, Mongo
      Week 7 - MEAN Stack & Project 2 (MEAN Project)
      Week 8 - Node/Express Templating & Rails
      Week 9 - Rails, SQL, Auth
      Week 10 - Rails & Project 3 Rails Project
    Final Project
      Week 11 - Project 3 & Review & Project 4
      Week 12 - Project 4

# Observations

## Interview Prep Every Morning

Projects and knowledge of frameworks will get people interviews, but only interview preparation can help students get jobs. In SF we have an hour of interview preparation every morning from 9:17-10:17 Monday through Thursday. Over 9 lesson weeks (12-3 project weeks), this gives the students 36 hours, the equivalent of 3 entire weeks of lessons, of CS fundamentals, data structures, and interview preparation.

## Projects Wednesday Morning to Tuesday Afternoon

Projects have been generally kicked off on Thursday or Friday afternoons and have been done on Friday mornings. This is an instructional anti-pattern.

By kicking off projects on Wednesday mornings (and not Thursday or Friday evenings) students are introduced to their project and then go directly into designing and building with help and guidance from instructors and TAs.

The students have now had all day Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of guided help before going into the weekend where their work is less guided and structured. On Monday students can touch base with instructors and TAs about their progress. And Tuesday morning is just finishing touches before the afternoon presentations.

## Tools
* **Node** - San Francisco has been teaching Node first since Q2 2014 and has seen students react overwhelmingly positively due to two reasons. 1. They gain more momentum with JavaScript. 2. They spend their energy in the beginning of the course on something "hard" and later (when they are more burnt out) do something "easy" with Rails.
* **Mongo** - Mongo is actually much more intuitive for students than SQL databases because they are already so familiar with JSON and JavaScript objects at this point.
* **MEAN Stack** - Teaching our students MEAN stack will increase their employability while teaching them the fastest trending framework and the pinnacle of JavaScript knowledge.
* **Firebase** - Firebase is an easy to implement asynchronous backend as a service. Using it as the backend paired with Angular for Project 1 will make this project into a much more full featured and impressive application. Firebase will make it so students can have 4 completed protfolio-worthy projects.
* **Ruby on Rails** - Rails is used in many legacy and some new code projects. It also introduces students to important technological concepts: synchronous processing, SQL databases, a class-based language. Teaching a new framework and language gives students the chance to deepen their understanding of fundamentals by relearning them in a new syntax and environment. In San Francisco, since we started teaching Node first, we have found that students find Rails very easy after Node, so it is not necessary to spend as much time on it.
