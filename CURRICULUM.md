# Curriculum - Teaching the Cutting Edge of the Web

We believe that in the right order and with proper framing, the cutting edge of web tools and frameworks are not too abstract for beginners nor are they "too magical" and at odds with the computer science fundamentals that are important for a well rounded software developer.

    Week 1 - Web & Javascript Fundamentals (Data Types, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS & DOM)
    Week 2 - Underscore, jQuery & Parse
    Long Weekend - Project 1 (Front End project)
    Week 3-4 - APIs, Node/Express API, Mongo
    Week 6 - AngularJS
    Week 7 - MEAN Stack
    Week 5 - Project 2 (MEAN project)
    Week 8 - Rails, SQL, Auth
    Week 9 - Rails
    Week 10 - Project 3 (RAILS PROJECT)
    Week 11 - Review
    Week 12 - Final Project

#### Curriculum Observations

* **Client-Side Architecture** - Everything except the three weeks on Rails focuses on a client-side architecture.
* **Parse** - Parse is an easy to implement synchronous backend as a service. Using it as the backend paired with jQuery for Project 1 will make this shorter project into a much more full featured and impressive application. Parse will make it so students can have 4 completed protfolio-worthy projects.
* **Node** - San Francisco has been teaching Node first since Q2 2014 and has seen students react overwhelmingly positively due to two reasons. 1. They gain more momentum with JavaScript. 2. They spend their energy in the beginning of the course on something "hard" and later (when they are more burnt out) do something "easy" with Rails.
* **Mongo** - Mongo is actually much more intuitive for students than SQL databases because they are already so familiar with JSON and JavaScript objects at this point.
* **AngularJS** - Teaching AngularJS in the first half of the course preserves and builds momentum to two main themes in the curriculum 1. JavaScript and 2. a Client Side Architecture.
* **MEAN Stack** - We believe that teaching our students MEAN stack will increase their employability while teaching them the fastest trending framework and the pinacle of JavaScript knowledge. Since the MEAN stack represents the technologies that are trending up teams will be starting new projects in these technologies and legacy code bases that are updating will be looking to hire more junior devs who are "hip" to the new tools.
* **Ruby on Rails** - Rails is used in many legacy and some new code projects. It also introduces students to important technological concepts: synchronous processing, SQL databases, a class-based language. Teaching a new framework and language gives students the chance to deepen their understanding of fundamentals by relearning them in a new syntax and environment. In San Francisco, since we started teaching Node first, we have found that students find Rails very easy after Node, so it is not necessary to spend as much time on it.

# Miscellaneous

#### Checkpoints for Projects

For the three complete-week projects, we make a required hand in of their user narratives, wireframe, and list of their kanban stories on Tuesday, so we can course correct for a project that is out of scope or identify students who are struggling. We might meet 1:1 or assign them to pair program for the project.


# A Note: Teaching Motivated Students

Traditional education environments are largely designed to help people study things they are not very motivated to study. What 8th grader really really wants to study European History? For many of our students and instructors, GA will be the first time that they experience a learning environment where the students genuinely and deeply want to learn the material. For this reason, we must for this reason hold all traditional learning activities and assessments.

One might think "But, wait a tick buddy, I was motivated in my traditional educational setting!" - probably you were! Would the learning activities, subject matter, and assessments have been different if all the students had been as motivated as you?

When teaching learners who choose to be there every day and are inspired to learn the content, we have the opportunity to dramatically change learning activities, subject matter, and assessments.

The lack of long lectures, textbooks, closed book/computer tests and quizzes, and the presence of light required work, and ample opportunity for optional work are all characteristics of education for motivated students. What else could we do better?


#### Focus on Outside-in-Development

Emphasis on Bootstrap and HTML & CSS.


#### Interview Prep Every Morning

Projects and knowledge of frameworks will get people interviews, but only interview preparation can help students get jobs. In SF we have an hour of interview preparation every morning from 9:17-10:17 Monday through Thursday. Over 9 lesson weeks (12-3 project weeks), this gives the students 36 hours, the equivalent of 3 entire weeks of lessons, of CS fundamentals, data structures, and interview preparation.

#### Friday Review & Weekend Labs

We have been having a lot of success going at a clip through concepts throughout the week and using Friday morning to do break out review sessions. Friday afternoon students begin working on a weekend lab, or if the next week is a project week, their project.
