# Flipping the WDI Classroom

We believe that General Assembly is the snazziest bootcamp out there with the best culture, and so it aught to be the best too. To that end, we have flipped the classroom for WDI in San Francisco. We are finding a flipped classroom gives rise to for fewer struggling students, less burn out, more impressive projects, greater student employability and higher NPS scores. What follows is a summary of how we **Flipped the WDI Classroom**.

#### We Made Longer Lessons

We've extended lessons from 90 minutes to 120 minutes to give the students more time to do work in a space where they have access to instructors, DIRs, and pair programming equipment. Doing this puts an emphasis on work done in the classroom where they are surrounded by DIRS and Instructors.

Students are still expected to work after 5:30 on finishing in class challenges, passion projects, an occasional evening lab, and studying the evening readings, videos, and tutorials for the next day's content.

#### Homework: Evening Readings & Prep

Each night students are required to read readings, watch videos, and complete short automated tutorials on the topics of the next day. Better prepared for the lesson, instructors can shorten their introduction to and demo of the module's topic to 20-30 minutes, and then give students 1.5 hours to work in pairs on provided **Basic Challenges** and **Stretch Challenges**.

#### Instructors Follow The 30 Minute Rule - Less Talking, More Doing

We've found that long explanations, demos, walk throughs, and code alongs waste important classroom time where students have the amazing opportunity to work with the support of each other and the instructional team. Instead we spend only 20-40 minutes of the 120 minutes of a module explaining and briefly demoing at a high level the motivation and concept of the day. The rest of the class is spent completing **Basic** and **Stretch Challenges**. This structure gives the instructional team the ability to sideline struggling students and unblock their learning.

Since teacher talk time is shorter and there is no weekday homework to create or grade, the instructional team shifts their focus to three activities that are of a much higher importance for students (especially for struggling students):

1. 1:1 mastery tracking of every student for every concept.
2. Shoulder-to-shoulder help of students who are stuck or behind on certain concepts.
3. Opening doors and challenging accelerated students.

#### Mastery Tracking & Student Success Ownership

Mastery Tracking means tracking the mastery of every student for every major concept. At GA we have the opportunity to provide a personalized education. During a weekly 1:1's instructional team members conduct white-board assessments of the major concepts covered since the student's last 1:1 and track their mastery in a shared spreadsheet. Targeted interventions are planed for students with less than a near or excellent mastery by that student's Success Owner.

#### Pair Programming

By purchasing usb ports, mice, and narrow keyboards (without numberpads), we have introduced Pair Programming into to the WDI classroom. Pair programming is an industry standard practice used in software dev teams in interviews and in the work schedule. Moreover, Pair Programming increases students ability to talk about code while at the same time reducing the frustration of getting stuck when learning to code, one of the biggest causes of burn out and student unhappiness.

### Friday Review days & Weekend Labs

We have been having a lot of success going at a clip through concepts throughout the week and using Friday morning to do break out review sessions. Friday afternoon students begin working on a weekend lab, or if the next week is a project week, their project.

## The Benefits of Flipping

Over all this multiplies success in a number of ways:

1. Every student is challenged to their maximum.
2. Reduced burn out and reduced frustration.
3. Struggling students have more help when they need it.
4. Strong students have more personalized challenges.
5. A trade off for instructors to prepare and lecture less and help students side-by-side more.

Our first NPS using this method of instruction was 34 and that was with extenuating circumstances around broken projectors, an entirely green team of instructors, a giant 44 person lecture every day, and scheduling conflicts with the rooms.
