# SF Innovations

We have been making rapid and dramatic shifts to the curriculum and instructional style of WDI in San Francisco and we believe these changes is the cause of our having fewer struggling students, less burn out, more impressive projects, and over all higher NPS scores. What follows is a summary of these changes broken out into two parts: **Curriculum** and **Instruction**.

## Curriculum - Teaching the Cutting Edge of the Web

We believe that in the right order and with proper framing, the cutting edge of web tools and frameworks are not too abstract for beginners nor are they "too magical" and at odds with the computer science fundamentals that are important for a well rounded software developer.

    Week 1 - Web & Javascript Fundamentals (Data Types, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS & DOM)
    Week 2 - Underscore, jQuery & Parse
    Long Weekend 2 - Project 1
    Week 3-4 - APIs, Node/Express API, Mongo, Auth
    Week 5 - AngularJS
    Week 6 - MEAN Stack
    Week 7 - Project 2
    Week 8 - Rails, SQL
    Week 9 - Rails
    Week 10 - Project 3
    Week 11 - Review
    Week 12 - Final Project

#### Curriculum Observations

* **Client-Side Architecture** - Everything except the three weeks on Rails focuses on a client-side architecture.
* **Parse** - Parse is an easy to implement synchronous backend as a service, so it stands in for a backend. Using Parse for Project 1 will make this little project a much more full featured application. Parse will make it so students can have 4 completed protfolio-worthy projects.
* **Node** - San Francisco has been teaching Node first since Q2 2014 and has seen students react overwhelmingly positively due to two reasons. 1. They gain more momentum with JavaScript. 2. They spend their energy in the beginning of the course on something "hard" and later (when they are more burnt out) do something "easy" with Rails.
* **Mongo** - Mongo is actually much more intuitive for students than SQL databases because they are already so familiar with JSON and JavaScript objects at this point.
* **AngularJS** - Teaching AngularJS in the first half of the course preserves and builds momentum to two main themes in the curriculum 1. JavaScript and 2. a Client Side Architecture.
* **MEAN Stack** - We believe that teaching our students MEAN stack will increase their employability while teaching them the fastest trending framework and the pinacle of JavaScript knowledge. Since the MEAN stack represents the technologies that are trending up teams will be starting new projects in these technologies and legacy code bases that are updating will be looking to hire more junior devs who are "hip" to the new tools.
* **Ruby on Rails** - Rails is used in many legacy and some new code projects. It also introduces students to important technological concepts: synchronous processing, SQL databases, a class-based language. Teaching a new framework and language gives students the chance to deepen their understanding of fundamentals by relearning them in a new syntax and environment. In San Francisco, since we started teaching Node first, we have found that students find Rails very easy after Node, so it is not necessary to spend as much time on it.

### Interview Prep Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs

Projects and knowledge of frameworks will get people interviews, but only interview preparation can help students get jobs. In SF we have an hour of interview preparation every morning from 9:17-10:17 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Over 9 lesson weeks (-3 project weeks), this gives the students 36 hours of CS fundamentals and interview preparation.

### Friday Review & Weekend Projects

We have been having a lot of success going at a clip through concepts throughout the week and using Friday morning to do break out review sessions. And Friday afternoon students already are working on weekend projects.

## Instruction - Flipping the Classroom

We have flipped the classroom in San Francisco and it is enhancing student understanding and facilitating instructor preparation.

#### Evening Readings

We assign a reading or readings and videos every night for the concepts of the next day.

#### Pair Programming

By purchasing keyboards (without numberpads) and mice and usb ports we have introduced Pair Programming into to the WDI classroom. Pair programming is an industry standard practice used in software dev teams in interviews and in the work schedule. Moreover, Pair Programming reduces the frustration of "getting stuck" when learning to code, one of the biggest causes of burn out and student unhappiness.

#### Longer Lessons

We've extended lessons from 90 minutes to 120 minutes to give the students more time to do work in a space where they have access to instructors, DIRs, and access to pair programming equipment.

#### The 33/66 Rule - Less Talking, More Doing

Instead of walking through a lot of code or giving lots of custom step-by-step instructions, we spend 30 minutes of the 90 minutes of a module explaining at a high level the motivation and concept and then we offer **Basic Challenges** that require the bare minimum of understanding. Then we create **Stretch Challenges** that stretch their understanding and challenge them to solve more abstract problems with the concept we introduced. We've found that the risk with this method is NOT that students will "slide by" doing the bare minimum. Instead, the risk is that students will try to do all the stretch challenges and get stuck or bogged down.

#### No Homework

Students are expected to finish the basic challenges and try the stretch challenges from the morning and afternoon modules, but we do not give them required work for after 5:30. Students can continue to work after 5:30, on passion projects and challenges, but the only required work for WDI after 5:30 is to read the **evening readings** for the next day.
